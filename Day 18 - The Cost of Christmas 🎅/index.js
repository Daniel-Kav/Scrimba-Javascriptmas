/*
ðŸ˜± Christmas can get expensive! 

You've been on a shopping trip and spent too much money. 
But how much of that can you blame on Christmas?

**Task**

- Calculate and return the total cost of only the gifts in the shopping cart.
- Each gift has the isGift boolean set to true.
- The total cost of gifts should be given to two decimal places.

Expected output: 559.93  

**Stretch Goal**

- Use the reduce() method to complete this challenge.
*/

function calculateCost(arr) {
    // Use reduce to calculate the total cost of items where isGift is true
    return arr
        .reduce((total, item) => {
            return item.isGift ? total + item.price : total;
        }, 0)
        .toFixed(2); // Ensure the result is formatted to 2 decimal places
}

console.log(calculateCost(shoppingCartData)) //559.93
